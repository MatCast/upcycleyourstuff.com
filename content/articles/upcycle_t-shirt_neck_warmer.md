description: How to reuse an old t-shirt to make a neck warmer. Don't throw your old t-shirt away. Use this idea to make a beautiful and simple neck warmer instead!

Here is the perfect upcycling Idea for the beginning of the school year and the approaching autumn. My godson starts school soon, he is six and he is now learning to read. Therefore I decided to sew a personalized neck warmer with his name on it, as a gift for his first school day.
Here is how it looks like once finished:

<blog-material-needed-card title="Iron-on Fabric">[optional] Single-sided or double-sided iron-on fabric for connecting fabrics (vliesofix) for better adherence of the letters to the fabric. Cut the letters for the name (must be identical to the cut letters from the T-shirt!)</blog-material-needed-card>

## How to sew a neck warmer

### Cut and iron

Cut the 2 rectangles: one from the T-shirt and one from the new fabric, and the name letters from the T-shirt and the vliesofix

Iron the letters together:

The vliesofix I used is one-sided, so I ironed the letters from the T-shirt fabric and the vliesofix together, and then I pinned them to the new fabric to sew them.

_**Careful, with a double-sided vliesofix**_, _you must iron the letters directly above the new fabric with the vliesofix in between. The iron must not touch the vliesofix so that the glue doesn't melt on the iron machine._

### Pin and Sew

Sew the letters on the new nice fabric with a wide and short zigzag Stich

Sew both rectangles with the right side inside along the long side. Here I use dan Overlock machine but it can also be done with a normal machine usin the zigzag Stich.

Turn inside out.

Fold in two and pin the two sides of the new fabric together.

Sew along the edge as long as you can, at least the whole length of the new fabric - Turn the sewed edges inside.

The last hole can be closed by hand.

## Your new Neck Warmer

And there you go! You can wear it as a neck or as an ear warmer, it looks amazing!

Without personalizing the neck warmer with the name, the project may be done in half the time! In 5-10 minutes you can have a couple of these for day to day use. For my 3 years old daughter I sewed many of these out of old robes just for school. I left one at school, another one is at home and a third one always in the stroller. A couple have been already lost somewhere in a playing ground, so it is useful to have many of them. If you wanted to only use old robes, the project cost is near zero!

I hope you find this idea useful and I am happy to hear about your feedback.
